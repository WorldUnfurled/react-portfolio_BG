## Description

Welcome to my new React portfolio website! I added new projects with new cards and changed the look of the sight overall. I kept the color scheme, but now it works as a single page app!

Highlights:

* Mobile responsive
* About Me page is revamped with the picture above the text now
* A contact form exists on the Contact page that will soon work properly with a backend implementation 
* Responsive Navbar
* Responsive Header
* Added Project cards that add a touch of design to the site
